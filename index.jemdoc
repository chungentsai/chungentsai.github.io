== About
Welcome to my website! My name is Chung-En.
I'm a research assistant in computer science at National Taiwan University.
I am fortunate to be advised by [https://sites.google.com/site/yenhuanli/home Prof. Yen-Huan Li] and to collaborate with [https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/bio1.php?id=1080917 Prof. Hao-Chung Cheng] since 2021.
Previously, I have worked with [http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/entity_people/entity_people/21478 Prof. Chun-Hsiung Hsia] and [https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~kmchung/ Prof. Kai-Min Chung].
I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from National Taiwan University in 2023.

I am broadly interested in machine learning theory and mathematical optimization.
I am currently working in online learning and large-scale optimization with logarithmic loss.
