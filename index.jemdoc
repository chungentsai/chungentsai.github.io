== About
Hi, I am Chung-En Tsai (蔡仲恩).
I am a research assistant in the laboratory of learning theory and optimization methods.
I am fortunate to be advised by [https://sites.google.com/site/yenhuanli/home Prof. Yen-Huan Li] and to collaborate with [https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/bio1.php?id=1080917 Prof. Hao-Chung Cheng].
I received my B.S. in computer science and information engineering from National Taiwan University in 2023.
Previously, I have conducted research under the supervision of [http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/entity_people/entity_people/21478 Prof. Chun-Hsiung Hsia] and [https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~kmchung/ Prof. Kai-Min Chung] in synchronization theory and computational complexity theory, respectively.

    I am interested in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_learning_theory learning theory], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization optimization], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system dynamical systems], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis numerical analysis], and related fields.
